| ----------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| SSOT Principles         | 30%       | ‚úÖ Appropriate (summary vs detail)     |
| Hybrid Approach         | 25%       | ‚úÖ Appropriate (summary vs detail)     |
| Documentation Structure | ~30%      | ‚úÖ Optimized (was 85-90%)              |
| Authority Mapping       | ~40%      | ‚úÖ Optimized (was 80%)                 |

**Unique Value**:

1. ‚≠ê Quick reference for time-constrained users
2. ‚≠ê Visual structure diagrams
3. ‚≠ê Scenario-based guidance (4 common workflows)
4. ‚≠ê System-level overview vs operational manual
