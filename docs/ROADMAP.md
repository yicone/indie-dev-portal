# Roadmap & Known Limitations

## üöß Known Limitations

### Current Constraints

1. **No Real-Time Updates**
   - Requires manual `pnpm git:sync` to refresh repository data
   - Changes to repositories won't appear until next sync
   - **Workaround**: Run sync command after making significant changes

2. **Local Repositories Only**
   - Only scans local filesystem
   - No GitHub/GitLab API integration
   - Cannot fetch remote repository information
   - **Workaround**: Clone repositories locally to track them

3. **Browser Security Restrictions**
   - `vscode://` protocol may be blocked by some browsers
   - `file://` protocol may not work in all browsers
   - **Workaround**: Use Chrome/Edge for best compatibility

4. **Single User**
   - No authentication or multi-user support
   - All data stored locally
   - **Workaround**: Run separate instances for different users

5. **Limited CI/CD Detection**
   - Only detects configuration files (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, etc.)
   - Cannot fetch actual CI/CD status from services
   - **Workaround**: Status is based on config file presence only

6. **Branch Information**
   - Currently shows hardcoded "main" for all commits
   - No branch detection or switching
   - **Workaround**: See [fixes/2025-10-26-last-committed-branch-display.md](fixes/2025-10-26-last-committed-branch-display.md) for planned solution
